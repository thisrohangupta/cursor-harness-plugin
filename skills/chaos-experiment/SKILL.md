# Chaos Experiment

Create and manage chaos experiments using Harness Chaos Engineering via MCP.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Infrastructure

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_infrastructure"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 2: Browse Templates

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment_template"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 3: List Existing Experiments

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 4: Create Experiment

```
Call MCP tool: harness_create
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body: <experiment definition>
```

### Step 5: Run Experiment

```
Call MCP tool: harness_execute
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment"
  action: "run"
  resource_id: "<experiment_id>"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 6: Monitor Results

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment_run"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

Get specific run details:

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_experiment_run"
  resource_id: "<run_id>"
```

### Step 7: Check Probes

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "chaos_probe"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

## Common Experiment Types

- **Pod Delete** - Kill pods to test recovery
- **Pod CPU Hog** - Stress CPU to test throttling
- **Pod Memory Hog** - Consume memory to test OOM handling
- **Pod Network Loss** - Simulate network failures
- **Pod Network Latency** - Add artificial latency
- **Node Drain** - Drain K8s nodes
- **EC2 Stop** - Stop AWS EC2 instances
- **ECS Task Stop** - Stop ECS tasks

## Chaos Resource Types

| Resource Type | Operations | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `chaos_experiment` | list, get, create, update, delete, run | Experiments |
| `chaos_experiment_run` | list, get | Run history/results |
| `chaos_experiment_template` | list, get | Pre-built templates |
| `chaos_infrastructure` | list, get | Target infrastructure |
| `chaos_probe` | list, get | Health probes |

## Examples

- "Show me all chaos experiments" - List chaos_experiment
- "Create a pod-delete experiment for checkout-service" - Create chaos_experiment
- "Run the weekly resilience test" - Execute run action
- "What were the results of the last chaos run?" - Get chaos_experiment_run

## Performance Notes

- Review existing experiments before creating duplicates. Check for similar fault types targeting the same service.
- Wait for experiment completion before analyzing results. Do not draw conclusions from partial runs.
- Verify the target infrastructure and service are healthy before running chaos experiments.

## Troubleshooting

### Experiment Won't Run
- Verify chaos infrastructure is connected and active
- Check target application/namespace exists
- Ensure RBAC permissions for chaos operations

### Probes Failing
- Check probe endpoints are accessible
- Verify probe timeout settings
- Review probe type matches expected behavior
