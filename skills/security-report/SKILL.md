# Security Report

Generate security compliance reports using Harness Software Supply Chain (SCS) and Security Testing Orchestration (STO) via MCP.

## Instructions

### Step 1: List Vulnerabilities

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "security_issue"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 2: Get Vulnerability Details

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "security_issue"
  resource_id: "<issue_id>"
```

### Step 3: List SBOMs

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "scs_sbom"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 4: Get SBOM Details

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "scs_sbom"
  resource_id: "<sbom_id>"
```

### Step 5: Check Artifact Components

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "scs_artifact_component"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 6: Get Remediation Guidance

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "scs_artifact_remediation"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 7: Check Compliance

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "scs_compliance_result"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 8: Manage Exemptions

List existing exemptions:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "security_exemption"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

Create an exemption:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_create
Parameters:
  resource_type: "security_exemption"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body: <exemption details>
```

Approve or revoke an exemption:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_execute
Parameters:
  resource_type: "security_exemption"
  action: "approve"    # or "revoke"
  resource_id: "<exemption_id>"
```

## Report Format

```
## Security Compliance Report

**Date:** <date>
**Scope:** <project/artifact>

### Vulnerability Summary
| Severity | Count | New | Fixed |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Critical | X     | X   | X     |
| High     | X     | X   | X     |
| Medium   | X     | X   | X     |
| Low      | X     | X   | X     |

### Top Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **CVE-XXXX-XXXXX** - <description> (Package: <name>)
   - Remediation: Upgrade to version X.Y.Z

### SBOM Status
- Artifacts with SBOMs: X/Y
- Compliance checks passing: X/Y

### Active Exemptions
- X exemptions active, Y pending review

### Recommendations
1. <prioritized fix action>
2. <next fix action>
```

## Security Resource Types

| Resource Type | Operations | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `security_issue` | list, get | Vulnerabilities from scans |
| `security_exemption` | list, get, create, update | Exemption management |
| `scs_sbom` | list, get | Software Bill of Materials |
| `scs_artifact_component` | list | Components in artifacts |
| `scs_artifact_remediation` | list | Fix recommendations |
| `scs_compliance_result` | list | Policy compliance results |
| `scs_opa_policy` | list | OPA policy status |

## Examples

- "Generate security report for backend-service" - List security_issue filtered by service
- "Show critical vulnerabilities" - List security_issue, filter by severity
- "Download SBOM for api-service:v2.3" - Get scs_sbom by artifact
- "Create exemption for CVE-2024-1234" - Create security_exemption

## Performance Notes

- Gather the complete vulnerability list before summarizing. Do not report on partial scan results.
- Cross-reference vulnerabilities with SBOM data for accurate component attribution.
- Quality and accuracy of the security report is more important than speed.

## Troubleshooting

### No Vulnerabilities Shown
- Verify STO scans are configured in pipelines
- Check scan tool connectors (Snyk, Aqua, etc.)
- Ensure scan results are being ingested

### SBOM Not Available
- Verify SBOM generation is enabled in CI pipeline
- Check artifact registry configuration
