# Scorecard Review

Review service maturity and compliance scorecards using Harness Internal Developer Portal (IDP) via MCP.

## Instructions

### Step 1: List Catalog Entities

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_entity"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 2: Get Entity Details

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_entity"
  resource_id: "<entity_id>"
```

### Step 3: Get Scorecard Scores

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_score"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

Get specific entity score:

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_score"
  resource_id: "<entity_id>"
```

### Step 4: Check Documentation

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_tech_doc"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 5: Review Workflows

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "idp_workflow"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

## Common Scorecard Categories

- **Production Readiness** - CI/CD, monitoring, alerting, runbooks
- **Security Compliance** - Vulnerability scanning, secrets management, access control
- **Documentation** - API docs, architecture diagrams, runbooks
- **Operational Excellence** - SLOs, incident response, on-call
- **Developer Experience** - Build times, test coverage, onboarding

## Report Format

```
## Service Scorecard Report

**Service:** <name>
**Overall Score:** X/100

### Category Scores
| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Production Readiness | 85/100 | Pass |
| Security | 70/100 | Needs Work |
| Documentation | 45/100 | Failing |
| Operations | 90/100 | Pass |

### Failing Checks
1. Missing API documentation
2. No SBOM generation configured
3. Test coverage below 80%

### Improvement Actions
1. Add API docs to /docs endpoint
2. Enable SBOM in CI pipeline
3. Increase test coverage to 80%+
```

## IDP Resource Types

| Resource Type | Operations | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `idp_entity` | list, get | Catalog entities |
| `idp_score` | list, get | Scorecard scores |
| `idp_tech_doc` | list, get | Technical docs |
| `idp_workflow` | list, get | IDP workflows |

## Examples

- "How is api-gateway doing on scorecards?" - Get idp_score for entity
- "Which services are failing production readiness?" - List idp_score, filter by failing
- "Help me improve checkout-service score" - Get score, identify failing checks, suggest fixes
- "Show all services below 80% compliance" - List and filter idp_score

## Performance Notes

- Analyze all scorecard checks before recommending improvements. Do not skip failing checks.
- Cross-reference failing checks with the service's actual configuration and documentation.
- Prioritize recommendations by impact — focus on checks that affect production readiness first.

## Troubleshooting

### No Scores Available
- Verify scorecards are configured in IDP settings
- Check entity is registered in the catalog
- Ensure data sources (CI/CD, monitoring) are connected

### Scores Not Updating
- Check integration sync status
- Verify data source connectivity
- Review scorecard rule configuration
