# DORA Metrics

Generate DORA metrics reports using Harness Software Engineering Insights (SEI) via MCP.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get DORA Metrics

Deployment Frequency:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_deployment_frequency"
```

Lead Time for Changes:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_lead_time"
```

Change Failure Rate:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_change_failure_rate"
```

Mean Time to Recovery:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_mttr"
```

### Step 2: Get Drilldown Data

For detailed deployment frequency:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_deployment_frequency_drilldown"
```

For detailed change failure rate:
```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_change_failure_rate_drilldown"
```

### Step 3: Get Team Data

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_team"
```

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_team_developer"
```

### Step 4: AI Metrics (Optional)

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "sei_ai_adoption"
```

Also: `sei_ai_adoption_breakdown`, `sei_ai_impact`, `sei_ai_usage`, `sei_ai_usage_breakdown`

## DORA Benchmarks

| Metric | Elite | High | Medium | Low |
|--------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| Deployment Frequency | Multiple/day | Weekly-Monthly | Monthly-6mo | 6mo+ |
| Lead Time | < 1 hour | 1 day-1 week | 1-6 months | 6mo+ |
| Change Failure Rate | < 5% | 5-10% | 10-15% | > 15% |
| MTTR | < 1 hour | < 1 day | 1 day-1 week | 1 week+ |

## Report Format

```
## DORA Metrics Report

**Period:** <date range>
**Team:** <team or org>

### Performance Summary

| Metric | Value | Rating | Trend |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Deployment Frequency | X/week | High | Improving |
| Lead Time | X hours | Elite | Stable |
| Change Failure Rate | X% | Medium | Needs attention |
| MTTR | X hours | High | Improving |

### Overall Rating: <Elite/High/Medium/Low>

### Recommendations
1. CFR at X% - invest in test automation and code review
2. Lead time trending up - look at PR review bottlenecks
3. Consider feature flags to decouple deploy from release
```

## SEI Resource Types

| Resource Type | Operations | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sei_deployment_frequency` | get | Deploy frequency metric |
| `sei_deployment_frequency_drilldown` | get | Detailed frequency data |
| `sei_lead_time` | get | Lead time for changes |
| `sei_change_failure_rate` | get | Change failure rate |
| `sei_change_failure_rate_drilldown` | get | Detailed CFR data |
| `sei_mttr` | get | Mean time to recovery |
| `sei_team` | list, get | Team definitions |
| `sei_team_developer` | list | Team members |
| `sei_metric` | list, get | Generic metrics |
| `sei_org_tree` | get | Organization structure |
| `sei_business_alignment` | get | Business alignment |
| `sei_ai_adoption` | get | AI adoption metrics |

## Examples

- "How are we doing on DORA metrics?" - Get all 4 metrics, compare to benchmarks
- "Compare DORA across teams" - List teams, get metrics per team
- "What's our deployment frequency trend?" - Get sei_deployment_frequency with drilldown
- "Show AI adoption metrics" - Get sei_ai_adoption and breakdown

## Performance Notes

- Gather metrics across the full requested time range before generating the report. Partial data skews results.
- Compare metrics across multiple time periods to identify trends, not just snapshots.
- Quality of analysis and actionable recommendations is more important than speed.

## Troubleshooting

### No Metric Data
- Verify SEI integrations are configured (Git, CI/CD, issue tracking)
- Check team mappings exist
- Allow time for data collection and calculation

### Metrics Seem Incorrect
- Verify deployment detection rules in SEI settings
- Check failure classification criteria
- Review team member mappings
